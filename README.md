This project uses real-world telecom customer data to build a machine learning pipeline that predicts which customers are likely to churn. It is a complete end-to-end data science workflowâ€”from data preprocessing and modeling to deployment-ready exports and interactive dashboards.

## Dataset Description

The **Telco Customer Churn** dataset includes demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

| Column Name       | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| gender            | Male or Female                              |
| SeniorCitizen     | 1 if senior, 0 if not                       |
| tenure            | Number of months with the company           |
| PhoneService      | Whether the customer has phone service      |
| InternetService   | DSL, Fiber, or None                         |
| Contract          | Month-to-month, One year, or Two year       |
| MonthlyCharges    | Monthly bill amount                         |
| TotalCharges      | Total bill over customer lifetime           |
| Churn             | Yes or No â€“ target variable                 |

The dataset is stored locally at: `data/telco_churn.csv`

## Dashboard & Risk Insights (Looker Studio)

This project includes a **Looker Studio dashboard** powered by **BigQuery + model predictions**, offering real-time churn visualization and business-ready reporting.

### Dashboard Pages:

- **Page 1: Churn Overview**
  - Churn by contract type, tenure, and monthly charges
- **Page 2: ML Predictions**
  - Total customers evaluated
  - Churn risk breakdown
  - Tenure vs churn probability
- **Page 3: Churn Drivers & At-Risk Customers**
  - Feature importance (Random Forest)
  - Segment heatmap (InternetService Ã— PaymentMethod)
  - Top 50 risky customers with `customerID`

## Outputs for Looker Studio

These files are exported from the ML pipeline and used in Looker Studio:

- [`feature_importance.csv`](data_outputs/feature_importance.csv) â€“ Feature importance (Random Forest)
- [`top_50_risky_customers.csv`](data_outputs/top_50_risky_customers.csv) â€“ Top 50 at-risk customers with `customerID`

---

## Business Impact

- Identify customers most likely to churn
- Enable proactive retention strategy
- Segment customers by risk and behavior
- Improve customer lifetime value (CLV) and reduce revenue loss

---

## Future Enhancements

- Build Streamlit UI for real-time prediction
- Integrate SHAP for explainable ML
- API deployment via Flask/FastAPI
