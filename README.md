# ðŸ“‰ Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses real-world telecom customer data to build a predictive model that identifies which customers are likely to churn. It's a complete end-to-end data science project from preprocessing to deployment-ready modeling.

---

## Project Structure

- `Techno_Churn_Final_Upload.ipynb` â€” Full notebook with preprocessing, SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and predictions
- `customer_churn_model.pkl` â€” Saved best model (Voting Classifier)
- `encoders.pkl` â€” Saved label encoders for future predictions
- `README.md` â€” Youâ€™re reading it :)

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler)
- Pickle (for model saving)

---

## Key Features

- Handles **class imbalance** using both **SMOTE** and **RandomUnderSampler**
- Trains multiple models: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost**
- Performs **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV` + `StratifiedKFold`
- Adds a **Voting Classifier ensemble** to combine strengths of RF and XGB
- Evaluates models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Includes **feature importance plots**
- Saves models + encoders for deployment
- Ready for **Streamlit web app** integration

## Best Model

| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Voting Classifier| ~80%     | *XX%*     | *XX%*  | *XX%*    | *XX%*   |

_(Exact scores are shown in the notebookâ€™s final comparison section)_

## Business Impact

A churn prediction model like this allows telecom companies to:
- Proactively retain at-risk customers
- Customize offers for likely churners
- Reduce revenue loss

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add Streamlit interface for real-time predictions
- Integrate SHAP for explainable AI
- Deploy via Flask or FastAPI
